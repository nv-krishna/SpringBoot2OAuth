<h3><span id="Getting_Access_Token_from_the_Authorization_Server"><span style="color: #000080;">Getting Access Token from the Authorization Server</span></span></h3>
<p>1) The user is asking the client to access my resource from the resource server (Google Drive) and review the documents.<br>
2) The client goes to the authorization server to get access of the resources on behalf of resource owners.<br>
3) Authorization Sever will check if the resource owner wants client to access his/her resource. Also asks the resource owner what all are the resources you want client to access on your behalf.<br>
4) Resource Owner replies Yes, I am the person who wants client to access some of my particular resources.<br>
5) After getting confirmation from resource owner, the Authorization server sends an Authorization token to the client.<br>
6) Then the client asks the Authorization server for an Access Token sending the same Authorization token along with its request.<br>
7) Authorization Server provides Access Token to the client to access required resources.</p>

<h3><span id="Getting_Access_to_resources_from_the_Resource_Sever"><span style="color: #000080;">Getting Access to resources from the Resource Sever</span></span></h3>
<p>8) The client sends a request to resource Server with Access token provided by the Authorization server to access the resources of resource owner.<br>
9) Resource Server validates the Access token provided by the client with Authorization Server<br>
10) Authorization Server validates the Access token and sends confirmation to Resource Server<br>
11) Consequently Resource Server provides access of resources to the client.<br>
12) Finally, Client (Document Review Service) reviews the documents using its internal application/software and provides review comments to Resource Owner(user).</p>

<p>Your starter class of Spring Boot Project should be annotated with @EnableOAuth2Sso like below code:</p>

<p>Step#1 : Select Project, right click on it, Run as &gt; Spring Boot App<br>
Step#2 : Open Browser and hit URL : http://localhost:8081/<br>
Step#3 : You will be redirected to the Facebook page as shown below. Also observe the redirected URL of your browser which is something like <mark>https://www.facebook.com/dialog/<span style="background-color: #00ffff;">oauth?client_id=****************</span>&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8081%2Flogin&amp;response_type=code&amp;state=1Gepzv</mark></p>
<p>â™¥ The above URL clearly indicates the magic of OAuth. ðŸ™‚</p>

Step#4 : Click on â€˜Continue as Your Nameâ€™<br>
Step#5 : Finally you will see below page with Facebook User details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, we are getting the user information of a facebook app even without logging into it. Thatâ€™s the capability of OAuth. ðŸ™„</p>
<p>Step#6 : Hit the URL <span style="background-color: #00ffff;">http://localhost:8081/user</span> , you will see all the details of user similar to JSON format.</p>
